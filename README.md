# flask-scheduler
A simple scheduler implemented using Flask, to be used as a standalone or integrated in a  more complex system

It uses Travis for CI and CD, deploying to Heroku in both staging and production apps.

Fabric is also used to facilitate the CI and CD tasks. By default, it will commit and push to current branch, not master
